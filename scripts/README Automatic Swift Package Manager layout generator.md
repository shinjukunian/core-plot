Swift Package Manager [has some strict requirements] (https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/blob/main/Documentation/Usage.md#creating-c-language-targets) to source files layout. We can gain SPM support with minimal project structure changes by applying an autogenerated layout based on symbolic links technics. SPM related files located under `spm` folder at project's root. You should **NEVER** modify it manually nor inlude to Xcode's project.

### Generate SPM layout for core-plot

1. From **project's root** run:

   `bash scripts/generate_spm_sources_layout.sh`

2. Commit Changes

Repeate those steps each time you modify/add project's files. **Make sure** to have this CI step which will check that `generate_spm_sources_layout.sh` is not broken.
